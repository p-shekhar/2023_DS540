This is a project-based course. Broadly, major topics covered in this course include:
<ol>
<li>Approximately first 60% of the course</li>
<ol>
<li>Fundamentals of Data Mining</li>
<li>Classification</li>
</ol>
<li>Remaining course</li>
<ol>
<li>Association</li>
<li>Clustering</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection</li>
</ol>
</ol>

The concepts that you learn in this course can be utilized to solve problems in the general area of machine learning and data science. Starting from the basics of data mining, we will go deeper into concepts of classification, covering multiple widely used algorithms that find immense applications in a wide number of fields from medical to engineering. The remaining course addresses the unsupervised component of the data mining domain. The concepts learnt in this section would be useful for finding and analyzing patterns in data which don’t have any labels (classes) due to various practical constraints such as data collection cost etc.

<h3><strong>Text Book</strong></h3>
The study material for the course would be provided to the students in the form of jupyter notebooks, pdfs and handwritten notes. Additionally, students are encouraged to refer the textbooks menntioned below for a much deeper understanding

In class, I will be broadly following the excellent (chapter-wise) presentation slides prepared by the main text authors and available at <a href = "https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php" target="_blank">Link</a>. Additionally, I will provide notes and jupyter notebooks related to concepts discussed in class.
